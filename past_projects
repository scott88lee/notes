Introduction:
I've been a FS developer for 3 years.
NodeJS AWS, VueJs. I like JS because its very quick to develop apps.


Reporting system: Two main functions
Client facing. Transactional information - Reports - Billing - Actions - Refunds, Chargeback
Internal Use - Funding / Billing

Microservices, Highly cost optimized... I think too extreme.
VUE.js SPA, api calls to lambda, offload some/significant to frontend.
  
CICD.
Infra as code. Everytime we deploy it runs cloudformation
Zero Fail deployemt, only bad code. 
Infinitely scalable, Lambda. Drawbacks, coldstart.
service to ping, or longer polling.


in the pipeline would be to to caching...
But doesnt solve problem of 1st query and interval.

Problems
Fullstack, Backend Engineering problems.
Limited by the choice. Limits.
Infinite scroll, pagination.
Starting to hit theoritical limits, of api gateway.

LEARNING: most useful CICD, speeds up production. Handle timezones.
Research more about limitations before embarking proj.

SAMIMA,
Trying MVC design pattern.

Day to day reporting. Inv levels, Credits/rebates.
Forecasting, setting of Par values, cal sellthrough rates.
Product aging

UI/UX. User input is a big issue. I cannot prevent user errors.
Come up with rules as I go along. POS in the future.

Bootcamp - But mostly self taught. Prev role solo product
Not pair programming, no code review. I wasnt sure if im doing the right thing or not. 
As long as it works its ok.

Im looking for an opportunity to learn to work in a team.
Im flexible
